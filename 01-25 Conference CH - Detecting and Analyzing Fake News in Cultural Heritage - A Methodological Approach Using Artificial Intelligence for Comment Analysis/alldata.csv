1,2,"I,ve  and my family  has been on Ester Island.  Great to see the many status. Very interesting   . Wonderful place . Amazing People üòç",1
1,3,Very interesting!!!,2
1,4,The bodies were discovered maaaaany years ago. Strange it keeps popping up as new discovery ü§î,1
1,5,This is so amazing.,0
1,6,This was discovered in the 50s. It's strange that it keeps popping up as a new discovery.,3
1,7,I've been twice on Easter Island. Great to see the many statues from nearby. Wonderful place and very nice people.,7
1,8,So so why were these statues buried that deep?? Interesting findings good work guys,5
1,9,It is funny how no one wonders why the carving of the canoe is like a 2 year Olds fridge painting and the statue is carved like fine art. I would think 2 different historical times in the life of Easter island.,4
1,10,I‚Äôd absolutely love to go to see these! ü•∞ü•∞,0
1,11,I‚Äôll never forget my trip to Easter island. The people were wonderful. I enjoyed it so much.‚ù§Ô∏è,16
1,12,Why is it special to suddenly realize that those moais bodies were covered with soil...if you know about basalt rock decaying...turns brown on outside caused by sun and rain...then it falls off the block of volcanic rock as clay and rock chips...then these gradually washed downwards along the mountain slopes in the process mixing with other organic matter...eventually it reaches the hillside standing moais...over hundreds of years it  gradually builds up until it reaches around the statues necks as you see before  digging..are you so stupid as not to realize that without even digging....it seems that you've just got out of the class room and then outside of the high-rise jungles...you are talking about something that is not part of your lives and not your type of culture hence your excitement over a minor aspect of something of not much significance....the is not yours ...it.is.in the people of Te Pito O Te Henua....give them the respect owed to them and their ancestors,5
1,13,Amazing!  I always wondered!,0
1,14,"My question is...
If they stood on Easter Island for eons of time...why is the body coloring not damaged ..there would have been some change to it and the elements would have damaged the whole body, not just the head ...I love archaelogy!",9
1,15,"This isn't exactly news. As early as 1914, archaeologists on Easter Island discovered that the heads of at least some of the megalithic statues, traditionally called moai, were attached to torsos. Personally, I read about this as long ago as the late1950's.",15
1,16,"Nossa, vai mudar a hist√≥ria e trazer mais curiosidades, se j√° era dif√≠cil  entender, imagina agora !!!!",7
1,17,"OSHA would be very upset with that dig. No shoring on the walls, potential cave in. However, this is awesome!!!",63
1,18,"Reminds me of finding my 5x great grandmothers lost inscription.  The stone is from 1789 and had sunk five feet by 1864 when every inscription that could be read were recorded.  He husbands, now worn away, was, but nothing for her.",1
1,19,Oh I‚Äôd love to do something like that!,19
1,20,"I think as you are trying to recreate the walking of the statues to show how they got moved, I think the (recently discovered finds that confirms) it is being overlooked that the beings during that day were 30 - 40 feet tall and most likely very heavy people, were unlike 5'-10"" - 6'-8"" being to 180 lbs being of today.  It's possible, they just carried the statues to the place they needed to go.",14
1,21,Amazing how much dust falls on the earth to bury these statutes so deeply  . . . Truly amazing to me.,36
1,22,Thank-you so much.  Incredible.,4
1,23,amazing that there are no other big stones around near by how where the stones brought there,4
1,24,That‚Äôs awesome I‚Äôve always been intrigued with Easter Island,46
1,25,Isso √© incr√≠vel eu espero que descubra todas as estatuas √© mostre essa maravilha para todos do mundo inteiro estamos ansiosos √© que seja muito breve ‚ù§Ô∏èüáßüá∑,6
1,26,Very interesting.good job,22
1,27,Bravo √† vous tous pour votre Courage. C'est vraiment super cette d√©couverte. Merci pour le partage,17
1,28,Truly amazing. Our true world mega history slowly is being reveled. Can you imagine what they will show us when the true secrets of the Pyramids and the Spinx are finally relieved. We will someday break the 11k BC wall.,28
1,29,The original garden gnome.,97
1,30,Would love to know what the carvings in the stone represent !!,15
1,31,Wow what a find !!I watched Good morning America when Micheal Strahan was there what a beautiful place and amazing people!,8
1,32,And if I am not mistaken.that looks like a boombox on its back,3
1,33,outstanding and total amazing. would love to go to Easter island,39
1,34,THINK OF HOW DEEP YOU WOULD REALLY HAVE TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE ISLAND TO FIND ANYYHING FROM THAT PERIOD,10
1,35,Bonjour √† tous je vois une grave erreur la personne qui est assise au fond au pied de la taille ne devrait pas √™tre l√† normalement il devrait y avoir un talus pour la s√©curit√© si le terrain s'√©boule elle n'aura pas le temps de bouger.

1,36,We were there.  Never thought they had bodies.  What a magnificent find.  How did create them? We will never really know and why there?,36
1,37,I didn't know they played racketball!,3
1,38,Just amazing,23
1,39,I wrote about it years ago and I still don't see a forest being planted on Easter Island,14
1,40,"Great Job, but if I was working at that (or any construction company) I would have ditch boxes, or wall supports at least. That is very dangerous and deadly.",12

1,44,Thor Heyerdahl excavated a statue in the 1950s and published his findings in his book 'Aku Aku' in 1958 so this isn't a recent discovery.,11
1,45,Joseph Lappin I neeeed the whole thing in my garden xx,5

1,48,Awesome thanks!! How were they made ? Could they have been pushed into the ground? Don‚Äôt think so!,10
1,49,Wow!!  That's incredible!!,16
1,50,Wonder why it took so long before someone decided to check it out?,59
1,51,Just tip it back a bit and I'll jimmy this bungee band underneath.,11

1,54,What happened to Erich von D√§niken's Chariots of the gods? Years ago I watched a debate between him and a professor from Harvard university. He lost because myths don't count in today's reality,2

1,68,I can‚Äôt understand why this type of article keeps circulating. Most of the statues aren‚Äôt buried and never have been buried. People have always known they were full bodies. This is incorrect information.,0
1,69,Very interesting!!!!,0
1,70,I didn't know that!,0
1,71,and it was discovered just now... How come it was not known until now.... how strange,0
1,72,"Absolutely beautiful !    Gotta love the history of our planet. !
Please don‚Äôt let the IDIOTS near it that have destroyed the American history in the form of removal or total destruction.  ‚Äî‚Äî-All without ACCOUNTABILITY.",0
1,73,I just want to know how they were able to make these an so many that size . Amazing,0
1,74,"If you see these, go see the Tera Cotta Warriors.  Literally thousands of them, and not one is a duplicate.  All different down to finger nails and shoes.  Circa 210 BC.  Horses, chariots, warriors, cooks archers etc.",1
1,75,Was that depth of soil deposited by weather to a height of roughly 15 to 20 feet since they were originally erected? Or did the dig soil extraction follow an old rectangular hole that they dug to part-bury the statues?,0
1,76,"Were once above ground, tectonic movement/ volcanic activity buried them???",0
1,77,"√â, somos muito mais antigos por esta Terra!!!",0
1,78,I love the carvings!,0
1,79,All those ladies still smiling and know how cold they just made him and gents are loving how quickly they dug him out and how work hard the women workedü§£ü§£,0
1,80,A lifelong fascination. Great shot. üé∂‚ù§Ô∏èüé∂,0
1,81,I like how we can how the statues would have looked like in their prime with their surface untarnished by time. Very very cool indeed!,0
1,82,This is astounding -- but not really -- but it is.  HOW did that much earth get piled up?  Were the statues 'buried' partially?,1
1,83,"Amazing! Thank you for sharing, son. ‚ù§Ô∏è",0
1,84,"I often wonder if they have always been buried and once used to sit on the surface, and were buried over time ???  Ôøº",0
1,85,This is where they were carved and abandoned before use.  The finished ones are the set up on podiums in lines along the coast lines...and all have bodies and have been seen with bodies for centuries.  This is NOT news or a find in any way.,17
1,86,In the past that sculpture was covered in soil but the erosion shift the dirt off the sculpture face,0

1,90,Visited this place more than 20 year ago‚Ä¶This have been known all along‚Ä¶ it is sad that they have disrupted them‚Ä¶ the earth actually protected the additional carvings on the Moai body‚Ä¶,0
1,91,Gobekli Tepe was intentionally buried. The bodies of these Easter Island masterpieces were undoubtedly intentionally buried also. The burial certainly preserved their art work.,0
1,92,Great to know - more to learn all the time,0
1,93,Are those bat-mitten rackets tucked into the back of his belt ??  ; - ),1
1,94,But it‚Äôs a special place.  Why couldn‚Äôt that have just left it alone,0
1,95,Looks like patterns on the back of the statue. I never realised that these statues had so much detail on them.,0

1,100,Wow! I love the Badminton rackets,0
1,101,"Hello, I'm from Chile.  The island is called RAPA NUI now.",0
1,102,I think that all of them all over the island were buried to the same place on thier necks makes this story a bit suspicious if not an outright scam,0
1,103,Super pic. Amazing pic. Nice wee thong on him and two tennis rackets tucked in. üòÇ,1
1,104,"You mean no one else ever dug down to see f there was a body!?!
The hippo teeth are really in odd positions. I guess they are affective on plants!",0
1,105,That IS amazing!,0
1,106,"What else could there be??maybe by digging a little deeper they could find something else like tombs or if they can get an actual age of the statue's and calculate how much dirt has covered them, because if you remove the dirt you would also need to remove some of the water,then project a line of view from the statue's to see what there looking at,could be a giant chess board ???",0
1,107,"It suggests that the people of the area at time were large and intelligent.

1,115,I believe we already knew that.  Many pics of the bodies just saying.  However awesome what y'all are doing.,0
1,116,Little did we know. I am happy permeation was given to excavate these statues.,0

1,124,FRED AND I WENT TO EASTER ISLAND 4-5 YRS AGO. THERE'S ONLY ONE PLANE IN AND OUT EACH DAY!! IT WAS WONDERFUL! THEY HAD SIGNS AROUND TELLING YOU WHERE TO GO IN CASE OF A TSUNAMI. ( LIKE ANY PLACE ON THAT ISLAND WOULD BE SAFE),1
1,125,These are amazing,0
1,126,holy smokes!!! I would love to see stuff like this in person!!!!!,1
1,127,I would imagine that these huge and heavy stone figures have been sinking into the soft ground on Easter island for thousands of years. I'm not sure how old these stone figures really are.,0
1,128,It took long to figure out there was more to just a head. Yeah great job üëè someone decided hey that‚Äôs dirt down some more,0
1,129,Wahou ! Encore plus impressionnant que ce qu'on connaissait. Magnifique travail de ceux qui ont creus√© pour d√©couvrir que les t√™tes avaient un corps. Magnifique travail aussi du peuple qui a dress√© ces belles statues,2
1,130,Would love to see these..look at the carvings on the stones..,0
1,131,Amazing that we‚Äôre just finding this out!,0
1,132,That‚Äôs amazing !!!,0
1,133,We have a summer place there...,1
1,134,We visited Rapa Nui and had the pleasure of viewing hundreds of these Maoi. They are amazing and the local history is fantastic to hear about. A much different story than we have been told.,0
1,135,"Have memories of this fantastic place, we spent a couple of weeks there. A stop over between Sydney and Chile.",0
1,136,What amazes me is the amount of dirt that has accumulated around them.,0
1,137,Any body thought maybe extretaresstial involvment  as with other items on Earth  No stones on that island    pyramids   mutcha ( cant spell it ) puchu     lines in deserts  temples carved into rockface ? Thousands of years ago mind    without pnumatic drils  lifting equitment etc   ( just my opinion ),0
1,138,Ôøº Noah and the great flood. That‚Äôs hÔøºow they were Ôøº buried!,0
1,139,Still a mystery How this big structures were built and moved around.various examples of similar things in south Americas and other parts of the world...,0
1,140,As a teenager read Thor Heyerdahl books.  I knew they had bodies. Also red top knots.  To make the statues the Islanders chopped down all the trees to move the huge blocks of stone. Plus they killed each other.  Read his book Aku Aku.,0
1,141,"And backpacks w breathing apparatus from the looks of it too, as well as those curly wire earpieces‚Ä¶",0

1,148,I always miss the Easter Inland and M.V.Regent Oat. I stayed there about 2 months in 1983.,0
1,149,Incredible! Who knew they carried a couple of tennis rackets in their waistbands? Or is that a giant pair of scissors?,0
1,150,I thought this was obvious. Why would they do just a portion of the head when so many others were clearly full figures? I assumed they were buried over the years of island storms and moving sand.,0
1,151,Looks like they have their pickleball paddles handy.,1
1,152,It just shows what a couple of thousand years of plant matter and dust deposits can build up the depth that hides the statues,4
1,153,"Were they buried up to their necks, or did the island get covered with dirt somehow? Either way, it is still a mystery.",0
1,154,Amazing it took anyone this long to figure this out.,0
1,155,I have visited this island in 2011 on my around the world trip. Very interesting island,0

1,167,I believe the statues to be much older that we are led to believe as shown by the amount of soil build up that half buried them . Perhaps part of the more ancient Lemuria,0
1,168,Just proves there was a great flood. Possible explanation how they were covered when the waters settled.,7

1,177,I can see this. Amazing. What else was you doing on Easter island at the time?,0
1,178,how many floods do they represent 50-75k years? the mud covering them is artificial? or several layers of mud from the floods?  what is the altitude of the plain? could we time this by soil types? ü§†ü§†,0

1,181,How fantastic do you know how tall they are yet I would love to be with you,0
1,182,Magique. Ils ont donc d√©gag√© tout ce qui se trouvait en-dessous pour lib√©rer la statue. Quel travail ! Comme ces statues inspirent le respect et comme c est bien que cette √Æle soit prot√©g√©e du tourisme de masse (si ce qu'on en dit est vrai).,0

1,185,"Studying the weathering and discoloration over time and, then, comparing the surrounding soil to determine if it was dug out or silted in over a wide area would determine the original depth it was buried on installation.  The discoloration and wear on the top appear to indicate a longer burial time compared to exposure time.",0
1,186,This amazes me since I have seen so many pictures of them laying toppled over. Does this means all are not below ground?,0
1,187,Mostly women on this project. Is that because they are really good at digging up the past?,0
1,188,That‚Äôs actually amazing and would be cool to see in person,0

3,407,Now I can say that with my body shape I am commemorating the heritage of Easter Island. Thank you <3,136
3,408,"Keep digging, he‚Äôs sitting on a horse üêé",270
3,409,We just blindly assumed they were heads sitting on the earth? I‚Äôm disappointed in humanity that we never explored this further until now üò¨ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,50
3,410,"Kind of disappointing, less unique, lots of statues have bodies. 
They should have quit when they were a head.",51
3,411,"I've noticed that things in the yard eventually become covered by dirt, leaves etc... during the erosion process. I wonder if these were actually buried, or if, over time, they were simply buried by the earth.",38
3,412,"I listen to the ‚ÄòNo such thing as a fish‚Äô podcast and first learned about these not so body-less heads. If you have a penchant for facts and myth busting, listen to the podcast.",28
3,413,That should tell ya a rough age. The sphinx was totally buried except for most of the head at one time as well. Nature buried these ancient statue's and tombs. These stories haven't been told truthfully,23
3,414,Perhaps a great flood buried them?? ...and swept away the people.,20
3,415,on the other side of the globe there are also stone statues with a similar pose  https://photographers.ua/photo/drevnie-bogi-415606/,16
3,416,I cannot beleive that this was really the first occasion to check it...,17
3,417,"I've read that given the average rate of overburden deposition, it would be impossible to bury the statues to that depth in the amount of time it is estimated to have happened. Meaning what? Meaning these statues are waaay older than is estimated.",13
3,418,"One of the great mystries of life, along with the pyramids. Would love to see them both someday  ‚ô•Ô∏è",8
3,419,Funnily enough Dutch explorers in the 1600s who landed on Easter Island and met the locals described the statues as having bodies and standing upright above the ground. So it's only at some point since then that they buried them up to their necks.,10
3,420,"https://youtu.be/7j08gxUcBgc 

For those looking for some deeper history. Carved from the mountainside and then pulled with ropes back and forth so they wobbled and thus walked to the beach on their own.",8
3,421,"What is even more interesting is to check out the experience made to show how the statues were ‚Äú walking ‚Äú 

https://youtu.be/YpNuh-J5IgE",8
3,422,"After many years, my wife also discovered that I had a body.",21
3,423,Are they holding their peen? Maybe it‚Äôs just statues of peeing. Are they sure that when it rains it doesn‚Äôt turn into a fountain?,22
3,424,"Been there twice when working on Norweigen ships, ship would anchor about three km off shore and  you would have to get a tender ashore. To get to the statues you could either get a taxi or ride there on a half wild horse. That was in the late 1960s.",8
3,425,It's amazing  I never knew  that there is a part of the body  also buried underground  We will gain more knowledge and information.‚Äã  what is very good,7
3,426,"This is the place, which I want to visit most of all in the world!.",6
3,427,Amazing. What took them so long to imagine or figure that out???,5
3,428,"This is old news!!!
The Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl found out this when he visited Easter Island in 1955-56.
You can read all about it in the book Aku-Aku. Just look up ¬´Aku-Aku¬ª at Wikipedia.",5
3,429,Yep‚Äîand their toes go all the way through the Earth and stick out at Stonehenge‚Ä¶.,5
3,430,I always wondered if there was more to these than met the eye!,3
3,431,"Like most old guys, they don't look so good below the chin.",5
3,432,Who do you think did this obviously not the people that live there there weren't enough of them on the island to move that s*** around,3
3,433,Now why did it take so long to think about this possibility,5
3,434,Well that's nothing new. There are many statues on the island that are not buried to the neck. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai#/media/File:Ahu-Akivi-1.JPG,12
3,435,They're placed strategically around the island to scare invaders most likely and over the years was buried when the volcano ( Mt. Terevaka) explodes.,5
3,436,"Wow, that's terrific , now things will be looked at anew.",2
3,437,"Because of deforestation of the island, there aren‚Äôt trees to hold the topsoil, so the wind just blows it away and it accumulates downwind, burying the statues over time. There used to be groves of palm trees covering the island, but they were all cut down by the original human settlers.",18
3,438,"Incredible, but five years ago this was discovered. However, thanks to this FB post, I would not have known at all! Don't remember it being on the news?",4
3,439,I can only imagine the joy that came when they decided maybe there was more.  Fascinating!,3
3,440,That sure takes the ‚Äúbury your head in the sand‚Äù to a new level!,3
3,441,Very interesting!! Awsome how they carved such huge figures with primative tools !! Pearl,0
3,442,"I cut the grass for my grandma for years. I used to have to pick the push mower up over some 8‚Äù blocks, but after some time I could mow over them. That was over a 7-9yr span. Nature will bury things.",1
3,443,"How do I volunteer to be a part of some dig that excavates these statues so we can see what kind of bodies they have? Apparently, they're all different! What a fun excavation that would be!",0
3,444,"The lesson to humanity that these statues symbolise is frighting.  

The Contiki is a great book about Thor Hyerdals adventure/ experiment",2
3,445,We saw these bodies up close and personal. With 800+ of these on the Island it was amazing to say the least.,0
3,446,"If you look at the mtn behind these you can clearly see the upper portion had clasped,leading to my conclusion these statues weren't covered in earth til there was a  landslide an I also believe these statues were molded.",2

3,459,This is so amazing. I  can't believe someone hasn't thought of digging down before? What a find.,2
3,460,could a natural disaster or volcano buried these statues and wiped the people out?,0
3,461,Never knew there was bodies!,1
3,462,"Very interesting. I read a book, ‚ÄúAku Aku,‚Äù 66 years ago about these heads sticking above the ground.",2
3,463,Not surprising I was awaits thinking that heads are on statue buried in ground by mil√©nia of erosion of the mountains behind it.,0
3,464,"Please check on YouTube Jon Levi, you will be astonished, all about the mud flood, so interesting. What is going on?.",0
3,465,"So has the level of the ground increased that much, or were these statues being punished?",3
3,466,"So, while they were on Spring Break, their buddies buried them in the sand & just left them, huh? Go figure!",2
3,467,Was there 3 years ago. Interesting how they sculpted them from the hillside.,0
3,468,It goes to show how many natural nature incidents there were to bury these beautiful statues.,1
3,469,My question would be how did they even get permission because locals of that Island are very protective of those things,0
3,470,"Keep digging,  you might find the horse they are on lol. Just kidding I truly love history. And we really don't know half of what's out there",0
3,471,Now that would be a cool place to visit. But I doubt you can now! X,1

How many of members from this grouop saw it with own eyes? Probably  none...",1
3,474,The one on the bottom right got a farmers tan from being exposed to the sun,2
3,475,"If anyone is interested to know more about this fascinating island. It‚Äôs out of print but try to find the book Aku Aku by Thor Heyerdahl.    
The headline is misleading - it‚Äôs long been known the the statues have torsos - a number were re-erected in the 1950s.",0
3,476,That‚Äôs amazing!  Were the bodies always buried or happened over time?,0
3,477,There is much history and mystery behind this island!,0
3,478,"Great they were in jail, and you just freed them.",0
3,479,I believe they got them selves in trouble and were buried to be stoned,0

3,482,"Not really new, most of their bodies are above the ground.",3
3,483,"Images are old news, from around 2010-2012, but knowledge about the torsos have been known since 1914.

‚ÄúIn fact, archaeologists have studied the statues on the island for about a century, and have been aware of the torsos beneath the statues' heads since the earliest excavations in 1914.‚Äù",0
3,484,Congrats to them please Shirley.,0
3,485,"Yeah, but didn't anybody read Aku-Aku back in the 60s? It's not like secret knowledge hidden by the elders and anybody who catches a glimpse of the sacred text is visited by the ghost of Thor Heyerdahl",2
3,486,Please read bookThiaooub proverb fro Michael Desmarquet. It explain origin of that stones.,0
